# Service Accounts Seperator
When you create service accounts, you need to add 100 each at a time and hence copy paste from json files to google group. This batch file will help you a bit by automating that stuff to sort out 10 accounts and hence easy to copy paste!

PS: With latest google limitations all cloning methods are dead but still you can add 100 members in one time
